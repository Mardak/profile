<h1>Welcome to a prototype of your User Profile</h1>

<h3>Below you'll see a list of interests and whether Firefox thinks you've
matched that interest based on how many days you've shown that interest. If you
turn on personalization, you can turn off sharing of select interests. To stop
interest calculations, disable this "User Profile" add-on.</h3>
